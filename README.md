This is the MVGC Multivariate Granger Causality MATLAB toolbox, previously
hosted at http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/mvgc

Current version is mvgc_v1.2, last updated Nov. 2021

**NOTE**: this version includes an implementation of the new, more efficient and accurate
state-space method for GC calculation, as detailed in:

    L. Barnett and A. K. Seth, Granger causality for state-space models,
    Phys. Rev. E 91(4) Rapid Communication, 2015.

See the file: *mvgc_demo_statespace.m* in the *demo* subdirectory.

This toolbox, developed at the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science,
University of Sussex, UK, provides MATLAB routines for efficient and accurate
estimation and statistical inference of multivariate Granger causality from
time-series data, as described in:

    L. Barnett and A. K. Seth, "The MVGC Multivariate Granger Causality Toolbox: A new
    approach to Granger-causal inference", J. Neurosci. Methods 223, pp 50-68, 2014.
